    text: "Firstly, I would like to thanks to all teachers of MANAS Team for giving me this opportunity. I would like to share that what motivated me throughout my journey in MANAS during JEE preparation. I joined MANAS in 2016. And I can clearly remember that My name used to come in last rows of the result list of Weekly Tests in 11th . But In Manas, there was a ritual to give Pen as a Reward to First 3 Toppers of every Test infront of the class. And that became the motivation for me that someday I would be receiving that pen infront of the whole class and I started following Pushkar Sir and Dharmendra Sir. I tried my best to be consistent and revise whatever they used to teach on daily basis. Their lectures were very helpful in getting more focused and being disciplined. I am very lucky that they were my teachers. With the help of their guidance, I got the opportunity to win those pens every week in Tests in 12th and also Secured AIR - 8090 ( General ) in JEE - Advanced 2018.Currently, I am working In ADANI Groups. Thanks MANAS and the Team.",
